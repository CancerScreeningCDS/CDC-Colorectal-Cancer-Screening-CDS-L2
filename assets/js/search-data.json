For patients with certain localized rectal cancers, additional local surveillance every 2-3 months for the first 2-3 after surgery/post-operative clearing colonoscopy should be considered. Routine surveillance intervals: * After the 1-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 3 years (4 years after surgery or postoperative clearing colonoscopy). * After the 3-year colonoscopy, the interval to the next colonoscopy should be 5 years (9 years after surgery or postoperative clearing colonoscopy). * Subsequent colonoscopies should occur at 5-year intervals, until the benefit of continued surveillance is outweighed by diminishing life expectancy. For patients with certain localized rectal cancers (e.g. partial, local or endoscopic excision or who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy), consider additional local surveillance with (flexible sigmoidoscopy or EUS) every 3-6 months for the first 2-3 years after surgery/perioperative colonoscopy. Intervals for polyp surveillance: If potentially precancerous polyps are detected in surveillance, the subsequent surveillance interval should be provided by the endoscopist, consistent with the shorter interval of: * Recommendations for post-polypectomy surveillance * Recommendations for surveillance after colorectal cancer resection (routine surveillance intervals above).
